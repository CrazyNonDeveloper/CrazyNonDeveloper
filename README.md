- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrazyNonDeveloper
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code as it's probably going to be mandatory to survive in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MySql, and DAX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on only small projects that can just help me learn the basics of coding.
- 📫 How to reach me 'I guess just messages on this platform.'
