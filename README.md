Hi, I’m Suhayb.

I’m building Kyrox: an early-stage, AI-first project and operations system.

My work focuses on reducing the time and attention teams lose to complex tools, with an emphasis on clear system boundaries, guarded change, and explicit context.

Most active development happens in private repositories. Public repositories here are used for technical overviews, activity signals, or supporting material.
